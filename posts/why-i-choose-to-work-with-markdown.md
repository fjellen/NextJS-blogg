Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
With this language you can easily create both texts and smaller components using only a text editor.

See the Cheat Sheet for Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).


This is a code snippet with styling from grey-matter and syntax-highliter written in markdown:

```js
// KBT
if (sad() === true) {
    sad.stop();
    beAwesome();
}
```

This is how the code snippet was written. I could have written the code snippet in a different language, and changed js to the other prefix.

```js
// KBT
if (sad() === true) {
    sad.stop();
    beAwesome();
}
```
