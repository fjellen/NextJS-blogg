## Building blocks

1. React
    1. Gray-matter
    2. Syntax-highlighter
2. Next.js
3. Markdown
4. MongoDB Atlas

## React

React is a **JavaScript library**.

With React you can easily create fast user interfaces for websites and applications alike.

React is a great way to build your application, react makes it easy to create all components and render them in different part of your application.

## Gray-matter & Syntax-highlighter

These dependencies helped me with the styling of the code snippets, its possible to have code snippets in markdown without them, but with them it is displayed in a prettier way.

```js
// KBT
if (sad() === true) {
    sad.stop();
    beAwesome();
}
```

## NextJS

As React is a **JavaScript library**, NextJS is a **framework for React**.

When i started with this project, i had never worked with NextJS, only heard of it from my studdy group.

So as a way to both challenge myself and to grow as a developer, I decided to learn NextJS.

See the docs for NextJS [here](https://nextjs.org/docs).
